# clustering-
implementation of k-means and bisecting k-means
Accuracy: 0.6562
Dimensionality Reduction: SVD
I have used truncated SVD to reduce the dimensions of the given matrix. But, the accuracy is very
low. So, I have not used dimensionality reduction for my final results.
Approach:
1. implemented K means â€“ cosine similarity is used to calculate the distance.
Kmeans(csr_mat, clusters)
{
for j in range (1, 25)
{
Centroids = pickCentroids(csr_mat, clusters)
Clustersmat = assignClusters(csr_mat, centroids)
recompute centroids(clustermat, csr_mat, cluster)
}
}

2. Implemeted Bisecting Kmeans by using k means
Bisecting_Kmeans(csr_mat, kclusters)
{
Initial cluster = csr_mat
Cluster_number = 1
Fill Clist[csr_mat.shape[0]] with 1
For k in range(1, kclusters)
For j range (1, csr_mat.shape[0])
If clist[j]==cluster_number
Target_mat =csr_mat[j,:]
Else
Clist[j]=clist[j]+1
Final_index=Kmeans(target_mat, 2)
Count no.of indexed per cluster_number
Target_mat= large_cluster
}

Internal Evaluation Metrics: Silhouette_score
The Silhouette Coefficient is calculated using the mean intra-cluster distance and the mean
nearest-cluster distance for each sample. Library from sklearn is used
sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score(X, labels, metric=cosine)
score = 0.0238202974302
The low score might be due to using, dimensionality reduction with components = 800, iteration
= 7.
